* Creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets
* Configuration of security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic
* Provisioning of an EC2 instance with Docker preinstalled
* Definition of any additional network resources required, such as an internet gateway, route tables, and network interfaces
